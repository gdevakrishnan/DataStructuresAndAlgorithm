TREES
    * It consists of Vertices (in Plural 'Vertex') connected with edges.

    * Trees are a Non - Linear / Hierarchical data structure
    * It has a Root node, Branch nodes and Leaf nodes
    * It has only one root node

1. Vertex (node)
    * It was block of a data.

2. Vertices
    * It was a collection of Vertex

3. Root
    * The top most Vertex (node) of a tree.
    * It has no parent.

4. Child
    * One who vertex (node) have a parent vertex.

5. parent
    * One who vertex (node) have more than 1 child.

6. Leaf
    * One who vertex (node) does not have even one child

7. Siblings
    * Nodes with the same parent

8. Subtree
    * Subtree is a tree formed by a node.

PROPERTIES
1. HEIGHT
    => Longest chain of vertices (nodes)

2. DEPTH
    => Longest chain of edges

TYPES
    * Binary Tree
    * Binary Search Tree
    * AVL Tree
    * Red - Black Tree
    * B - Tree

NOTE
BINARY TREE vs BINARY SEARCH TREE
    * BINARY TREE consist of atmost two child called as left child and right child.
    * BINARY SEARCH TREE const of two childs like Binary Tree but, The RIGHT CHILD IS GREATER THAN LEFT CHILD.
