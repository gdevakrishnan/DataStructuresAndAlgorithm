DATA STRUCTURE
    * It was used to STORE and ORGANIZE data in a structure.

ALGORITHM
    * It is a Step by Step procedure to solve a problem.

TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURE
    1. PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURE
    2. NON - PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURE

1. PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURE
    * It was a basic and fundamental Data structures
        
        => INT
        => FLOAT
        => CHAR
        => BOOLEAN

2. NON - PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURE
    * It was a complex data structure
    * It was used to store collection of data

        => LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
        => NON - LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE

2.1 LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
    * It was used to store data linearly
    * Each elements connect with only one element
    * It have START and END point

        => ARRAYS
        => LINKED LIST
        => STACK    (FILO)
        => QUEUE    (FIFO)

2.2 NON - LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE (HIERARCHICAL Data structure)
    * It was not arranged in a sequential order
    * Each element connects with multiple element
    * It was in HIERARCHICAL order.

        => TREES
        => GRAPHs
        => HEEP
        => HASH TABLE
